Rules for if statements:
------------------------
Every if statement must have an else.
If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense then you must use a die funtion in the else that prints out an error message and dies.
Never nest ifs more than two deep and try to keep them one deep.
Treat ifs like paragraphs, where each if-elsif-else grouping is like a seperate set of sentences.
Boolean tests should be simple, if they are complex move their calculations to vars earlier in your function.

Rules for loops:
----------------
Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never.
Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially for a fixed inteneded number of loops.

Debugging:
----------
The die statement.
Use puts to print out your vars so you can see what's going wrong.
Make sure small vyte sized chunks of your code work.
