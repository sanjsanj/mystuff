Did you start your function with def?
Does your function name have only characters and underscores?
After the function name did you put an open parenthesis followed by your arguments followed by a close parenthesis?
Did you make each argument unique?
Did you indent all lines of code within the function space?
Did you end your function with end lined up with def?

When running your function:
---------------------------
Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
Did you put the values you want the function to use in parenthesis after the function name?
